# underbar-review
This is a project I completed as a student at [hackreactor](http://hackreactor.com). This project was worked on with a pair.

# Recursion is a technique for solving problems wherein a function makes calls to itself. By doing so, it can complete a small amount of the processing, and delegate the rest of the problem to the recursive calls.

# In this sprint, you'll be reimplementing parts of the browser that involve recursion. In so doing, don't use the things you're reimplementing, or any other built-in shortcuts that make these problems trivial.
